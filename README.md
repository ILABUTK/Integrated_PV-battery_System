## Description

The goal of this repository is to provide the optimal long-term battery operational policy for a PV-battry system implemented in a residential house.

The codes contain three parts to replicate the results shown in the manuscript. First, we provide codes to replicate the plots in Section 4.1 of the manuscript. Then, we provide codes to replicate Table 2 of the manuscipt. Finally, we provide codes to replicate the algorithm comparison results in Section 5 of the manuscript.

## Python Prerequisite

The following Python libraries are required to run the source codes:
1. `numpy`;
2. `scipy`;
3. `torch`;
4. `pandas`;
5. `pickle`;
6. `matplotlib`.

## Usage

Simply run the Python files in each directory.
